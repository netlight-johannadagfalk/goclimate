## Button

The button component is not exclusive to the `<button>` element, it can be used on `<a>` elements as well. We have a default button class which we can combine with other classes for different types of buttons.

- `button` is our default button class and perfectly fine to use on its own. If you need a regular button, this is your friend. It is the base of all other types of buttons.
- `button-inverted` is a light version of the default button, meaning it's white outlines with white text. This button should be used on dark backgrounds. It has to be used in combination with the default button class to work properly.
- `button-cta` is a button that calls for the user's attention. This is used when we want the user to take an action, such as to log in, to sign up or to get started. It has to be used in combination with the default button class to work properly.

### Examples

Default buttons

```
<button type="button" class="button">I am a regular button</button>
<a href="#" class="button">I am too a regular button</a>
```

Combination buttons

```
<button type="button" class="button button-inverted">I am an inverted button</button>
<a href="#" class="button button-cta">Give me attention!</a>
```

## Callout

A simple box that has the purpose to highlight important information or interaction. I should have some sort of size limitation, whether if it's max width or controlled by a parent element - it should not be used as a fullscreen element. It should not be used on the same element as `section-gutter` or `section-padding`. 

### Examples

```
<div class="callout max-w-lg mx-auto">
  I am inside a callout. I am important!
</div>
```

## Collapse

This is component that on toggle collapses or expands a content box - all just HTML and CSS. It is however important to keep the markup correct for it to function properly.

### Examples

Basic usage

```
<div class="collapse">
  <input id="some-sort-of-element-id" type="checkbox">
  <label for="some-sort-of-element-id" class="cursor-pointer">
    Click me to toggle the content!
  </label>
  <div class="collapse-content pt-4">
    <p>I am the content that will be revealed or hidden.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Usage with animated chevron. Notice the class `collapse-chevron`.

```
<div class="collapse">
  <input id="some-sort-of-element-id" type="checkbox">
  <label for="some-sort-of-element-id" class="flex justify-between cursor-pointer">
    <p>Click me to toggle the content!</p>
    <div class="pl-3">
      <i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down collapse-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
  </label>
  <div class="collapse-content pt-4">
    <p>I am the content that will be revealed or hidden.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Dropdown

This is an HTML and CSS component that is a toggleable dropdown menu. By default the menu places itself below the trigger element and is left aligned, it can however be placed above and/or right aligned. 

### Examples

Default use case

```
<div class="dropdown"> 
  <input id="some-sort-of-element-id" type="checkbox" class="dropdown-toggler">
  <label for="some-sort-of-element-id" class="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
    Click me to open dropdown
  </label> 
  <ul class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="some-sort-of-element-id"> 
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul> 
</div>
```

Dropdown menu, right aligned. Notice the additional class on the `dropdown-menu` element.

```
<div class="dropdown"> 
  <input id="some-sort-of-element-id" type="checkbox" class="dropdown-toggler">
  <label for="some-sort-of-element-id" class="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
    Click me to open dropdown
  </label> 
  <ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right" aria-labelledby="some-sort-of-element-id"> 
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul> 
</div>
```

Dropup menu, the menu is positioned above the trigger. Notice the additional class on the `dropdown-menu` element.

```
<div class="dropdown"> 
  <input id="some-sort-of-element-id" type="checkbox" class="dropdown-toggler">
  <label for="some-sort-of-element-id" class="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
    Click me to open dropdown
  </label> 
  <ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-up" aria-labelledby="some-sort-of-element-id"> 
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul> 
</div>
```

## Headings

These are helper classes to keep our headings consitent and responsive. The font size and font weight is handled, not the margin or padding.

- `heading` is quite similar to body text in size and is typically used to accentuate smaller things that is not a page header or section header.
- `heading-lg` is typically used in sections of a page. 
- `heading-xl` is to be used as the headline of a page and should generally only be used once. Usually it's used on an `<h1>` element.

### Examples

A typical use case for the different classes.

```
<h1 class="heading-xl">
  Welcome to a very cool page
</h1>

<h2 class="heading-lg">
  Let me describe this section for you
</h2>

<h3 class="heading">
  Here is a regular heading, headlining a paragraph
</h3>
```

## Input

Styling of the native HTML element.

### Examples

Basic usage.

```
<input type="text" class="input">
```

Usage with rails form helper class.

```
<%= my_form.email_field :email, required: true, id: "email", class: "input" %>
```

## Link

Styling of the native HTML element. There are multiple link classes for different use cases. 

- `link` is to be used within in running text, usually in a `<p>`
- `link-icon` TBA
- `link-ui` is to be used when it's not in a running text but rather as an UI element, for instance in a navigation bar.

### Examples

```
<p>
  I am a text that is a little longer and I also contain a very cool <a href="#" class="link">link</a>, how about that, huh?
</p>
```

UI link use case.

```
<ul>
  <li><a href="#" class="link-ui">Navigation link 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="#" class="link-ui">Navigation link 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="#" class="link-ui">Navigation link 3</a></li>
</ul>
```

## Lists

By our default CSS normalization and Tailwind preflight, `<ul>` and `<ol>` are unstyled. These are some components that styles `<ul>` or `<ol>` into lists that can be used in running text.  

### Examples

```
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>I have a point</li>
  <li>I too, have a point in this list</li>
  <li>What is the point?</li>
</ul>
```

## Modal

Modal is component that requires Javascript to function properly, it's however pretty simple to use out of the box. The component is composed of five classes, where only four needs to be used when implementing a modal; `modal-close-button` is added by the controller for simplicity. To make the modal interactive, use the Javascript controller `modal`. See implementation below.

- `modal-container` takes care of the modal layer and dark overlay background
- `modal-content` is the actual modal, it's basically the same styles as in a `callout`
- `modal-heading` is a simple heading class that adds right padding to not interfere with the close "x" buton of the modal
- `modal-close-button` positions the close button in the top right corner of the modal. NB! This is added by the controller
- `modal-actions` positions the modal actions, i.o.w. the buttons. NB! This class assumes the actions have the class `button` applied to them

Possible improvements:

- Making a Rails template for the markup

### Examples

```
<div data-controller="modal">
  <button data-target="modal.trigger" data-action="modal#open">I open the modal</button>

  <div class="modal-container" data-target="modal.container">
    <div class="modal-content" data-target="modal.content">
      <h3 class="modal-heading">My modal heading</h3>
      <p>My modal content</p>
      <button data-action="modal#close">Close modal</button>
      <button>Confirm modal</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Radio

Custom styling of radio inputs. The biggest advantage is the custom styling is consistent across browsers. And it's of course possible to use our own colors!

Possible improvements:

- Making a Rails template for the markup

### Examples 

```
<label class="radio">
  <input type="radio" name="agreement" value="yes">
  <span class="radio-input"></span>
  Yes, I agree
</label>
```

## Section gutter

Section gutter is to be used together with `section padding`, and makes sure there is gutter space between the items.

### Examples

```
<section class="section-padding">
  <div class="section-gutter">
    <div>
      I have some content.
    </div>
    <div>
      I have some other content.
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Section padding

When creating a regular page that has sections, this class comes in handy to keep the padding consistent and responsive. When having multiple columns, use in combination with `section gutter`.

### Examples

```
<section class="section-padding">
  I have some content that will have appropriate padding on different breakpoints.
</section>
```

## Select

Styling of the native HTML element. As it's not possible to use psuedo selectors on the `select` element, the markup requires a wrapper, which takes care of styling the chevron. It is possible to use without the wrapper, but the styling of the chevron then falls back to browser default as a way of alerting you of incorrect markup.

### Examples

Basic usage

```
<div class="select-wrapper">
  <select class="select">
    <option value="economy">Economy</option>
    <option value="premium_economy">Premium Economy</option>
    <option value="business">Business</option>
    <option value="first">First</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

Controlling the width is done on the wrapper element.

```
<div class="select-wrapper w-full">
  <select class="select">
    <option value="economy">Economy</option>
    <option value="premium_economy">Premium Economy</option>
    <option value="business">Business</option>
    <option value="first">First</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

## Tabs

Tabs makes it possible to have content in a tabbed view. Tabs is a component that heavily depends on Javascript to work properly. It uses the Stimulus.js controller `tabs`, which requires three targets: `tablist`, `tab`, `panel`. The elements `tab` and `panel` are connected by their DOM order, so keep that in mind. Moreover, the tab component is only a tabbed view from breakpoint `m-lg`, on mobile it shows the contents in a column.

```
<div data-controller="tabs">
  <ul data-target="tabs.tablist">
    <li>
      <a href="#" data-target="tabs.tab">Section 1</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#" data-target="tabs.tab">Section 2</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <section data-target="tabs.panel">
    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. <a class="link" href="#">Nam luctus</a>, enim in interdum condimentum, nisl diam iaculis lorem, vel volutpat mi leo sit amet lectus.</p>
  </section>
  <section data-target="tabs.panel">
    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <p>Nullam at diam nec arcu suscipit auctor non a erat. Sed et magna semper, eleifend magna non, facilisis nisl. Proin et est et lorem dictum finibus ut nec turpis.</p>
  </section>
</div>
```

## Toggler

Toggler is a set of helper classes that makes it possible to control elements on toggle, all with HTML and CSS. The markup takes advantage of input checkbox and CSS sibling selectors. It is important to keep the markup correct in order to achieve the desired functionality.

- `toggler` should be placed on the checkbox being used as the toggle.
- `toggler-checked` is a prefix to be used with utility classes. In practice it works like breakpoints, so that when the toggler is checked, the utility class is applied. The following classes work:
  - `toggler-checked:h-screen`
  - `toggler-checked:scale-y-100`
  - `toggler-checked:opacity-100`

### Examples

```
<input type="checkbox" id="my-toggler-id" class="toggler">
<div class="opacity-0 toggler-checked:opacity-100">
  I am invisible until the toggler is checked!
</div>

<label for="my-toggler-id">
  Click me to toggle!
</label>
```
