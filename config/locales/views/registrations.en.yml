          heading: What does my carbon footprint consist of?
          text: The main areas to look at in terms of your footprint are housing, food, travelling with car and flights, as well as shopping and public emissions. Housing and car emissions can differ quite a lot depending on what country you live in, so does public emissions - which includes infrastructure, hospitals, education etc. The areas where most of us can make choices that have a high impact on our carbon footprint in a fairly short amount of time, are generally food and shopping, as well as looking over how we travel. The public emissions and shopping part of your carbon footprint can be reduced by roughly between 1-5 tonnes, by making conscious choices and changing your consumption habits.

          offsetting:
            heading: Balance your emissions
            text: The most crucial thing we as individuals have to do in order to combat climate change is to reduce our own emissions. A great complement to a more climate friendly lifestyle is to balance your carbon footprint by supporting climate projects, in order to take full responsibility for your emissions.
