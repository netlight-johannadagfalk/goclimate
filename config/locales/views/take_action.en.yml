          heading: Offset flights
          text: The best thing for the climate is to keep flights to a minimum and to choose less carbon exhaustive options to get around. However, when staying on the ground is not an option, carbon offsetting is a way to take responsibility for the emissions caused. We offer the possibility to offset your flight in certified climate projects, stopping the amount of CO2 caused from being released elsewhere.
